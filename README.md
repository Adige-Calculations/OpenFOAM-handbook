## What this book is all about?
----------------------------------------
This book describes the usual practices a medium/advanced OpenFoamÂ® user
takes during CFD smulations workflows. Shortcuts and support are given for the every-day
use.
It should be seen as a co-pilot to remember commands or take inspiration
for your CFD workflow, instead of a place to study on.
