## What this book is all about?
This small book describes the usual practices a medium/advanced OpenFoamÂ® user
takes during CFD smulations workflows. Shortcuts and support are given for the every-day
use and this book should be seen as a co-pilot to remember command or take inspiration
for your CFD workflow, instead of a place to study on.
