# Function Objects

Function objects are essentially pre-built modules that empower users to monitor control 
points, compute forces and coefficients, perform time-averaging of fields, extract surfaces and slices, 
and much more â€” all in real-time and without requiring additional coding. These built-in utilities are defined 
and loaded in ```controlDict```. When leveraged effectively, function objects eliminate the necessity of storing 
all run-time simulation data, leading to significant resource  savings. Here are some additional details on what 
we use function objects for:

- Monitor probes : Probes are basically control points in your domain where values of certain fields are monitored
  over simualtion time. This feature is particularly useful for tracking critical locations or assessing the behavior 
  of specific variables over time. For example, one can track statistical convergence using probes.
- Calculate forces and force coefficients : Users can compute forces and force coefficients acting on surfaces or boundaries within the simulation domain. This capability is essential for analyzing fluid-structure interactions, aerodynamic performance, and other engineering phenomena. For example, wind load on buildings, drag and lift forces acting on an airfoil, and so on.
- Calculate time-averaged fields : Function objects enable the calculation of time-averaged fields, providing insights into the steady-state behavior of the simulation. This is beneficial for understanding long-term trends and minimizing the influence of transient effects.
- Extract slice information : Users can extract surfaces or slices from the computational domain using function objects. This functionality is valuable for visualizing specific regions of interest or exporting data for further analysis such as Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (POD), Dynamic Mode Decomposition (DMD), and so on.
- Custom data processing : Beyond the built-in functionalities, function objects can be customized to perform user-defined data processing tasks. This flexibility allows users to tailor post-processing routines to their specific requirements, enhancing the utility of OpenFOAM for diverse applications.

## How to use Function Objects

Function objects serve dual purposes: 

- being employed during runtime within the simulation
- accessed via command-line post-processing utilities 

Typically, function objects excel in runtime investigations, offering invaluable insights. To utilize 
function objects, each selected function must be listed within the functions sub-dictionary of the ```system/controlDict``` file, 
structured as a nested sub-dictionary, as illustrated in the following example:

```c#
...

runTimeModifiable true;

functions
{
  <userDefinedSubDictName2>
    {
      ...
    }

  <userDefinedSubDictNameN>
  {
    ...
  }
}
```

Another approach to implementing function objects in controlDict is by including the file that contains them. For instance, if I define a probe function object file named probes or surfaces function objec file, I can include it in controlDict as shown below:

```c#
functions
{
  #includeFunc probes
  #includeFunc surfaces
}
```
