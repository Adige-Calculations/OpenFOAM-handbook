# polyMesh

Contains all the mesh details as:

## Sets
Each set you will create i.g. through

```c
checkMesh;   // or
topoSet;     // or
setSet;
```
It will be stored in this document diversifying between:

  - pointZone

  - faceZOne

  - cellZone

## boundary
Each patch can be put inGroups for pre and post-processing purpose. Each
patch can thus be in several groups. The patchGroup generated by this
makes e.g. setting of boundary conditions easier. A patch boundary
condition definition takes precedence over a patchGroup boundary
condition.
