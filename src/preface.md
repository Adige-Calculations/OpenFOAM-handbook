# Preface
This handbook is intended to support a medium/advanced OpenFoam® user
during the usage of the software. It provides commands, explanations,
and extension that we find useful during our CFD workflow, and it is
designed to be used by searching for keywords of an action you wish to
perform within the OpenFoam® framework. This allows you to enrich or
resolve the setting of a problem in the shortest possible time.
