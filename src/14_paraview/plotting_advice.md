# Plotting advice 

Often it is necessary to display varibale over a line. Via the shortcut ```Ctrl``` + ```space-bar``` you can rise the filer menu and type "Plot over line". This will ask to draw a line which is dificult to place.
The best way to use plot over line is through slicing the domain and the slice again the 2D plane on the location of interest. The filter will automatically recognize the 1D domain resulted by the interesection of two planes.
