# Advanced refinement technique


The necessity to refine area that sometimes require a complex shape can
be satisfied through the usage of an STL file as a cellZone entry.
First, define a closed STL file through snappyHexMeshDict.geometry then
use this frame in the respective snappyHexMeshDict sector

```c++
    refinementSurfaces
    {
        <closeSTLFileYouWantToRefine>
        {
            level (1 2);

            cellZone <\name\>;
            faceZone <\name\>;
            cellZoneInside inside;
        }
      â€¦
    refinementRegions
    {
        <closeSTLFileYouWantToRefine>
        {
            mode <\mode\>;
            levels ((0.000008 3));
        }
    }
```
