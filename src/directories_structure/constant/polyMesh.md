## Sets

A set is an ordered part of the mesh (often a portion of the domain), usually produced by the 
utilities: ```checkMesh```,```topoSet``` or ```setSet```

Diversifying the output between:

  - pointZone
  - faceZone
  - cellZone

## Boundary

Each patch can be put inGroups for pre and post-processing purpose. Each
patch can thus be in several groups. The patchGroup generated by this
makes e.g. setting of boundary conditions easier. A patch boundary
condition definition takes precedence over a patchGroup boundary
condition.
