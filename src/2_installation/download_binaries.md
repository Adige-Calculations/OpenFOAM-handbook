if the packages are not availble for your distribution, download the precompiled binaries instead:

```console
wget https://dl.openfoam.com/source/v2206/OpenFOAM-v2206.tgz -P /opt/OpenFOAM
wget https://dl.openfoam.com/source/v2206/ThirdParty-v2206.tgz -P /opt/OpenFOAM
```
These command will download a .tar archive conatining the all necessary file to make the software working on the ```opt/OpenFOAM``` directory.
