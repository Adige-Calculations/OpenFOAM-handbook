# Installation

The installation of OpenFoam® is possible through three differetn methods:

  - Directly installing the binaries from a packages manager (not all Linux distribution can take advantage of this method)

  - Extracting the already compiled package from the OpenFoam® websites

  - Compiling from the source code

## Suggested location in the linux file system

Wheater you do not use a package manger, you must choose where to install the software; it is suggested to install it on the directory

```sh
sudo mkdir -p /opt/OpenFOAM
```

Where ```/opt```stands for optional software on the Linux file system
